## Race - Goliath
_**Little Giant.**_ You have proficiency in the Athletics skill, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying weight and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.  
_**Mountain Born.**_ You have resistance to cold damage. You also naturally acclimate to high altitudes, even if you've never been to one. This includes elevations above 20,000 feet.  
_**Stone's Endurance.**_ You can supernaturally draw on unyielding stone to shrug off harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total.  
You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.  
_**Languages.**_ You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.

## Class - Ranger/Hunter
_**Favored Enemy.**_ Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.  `Orcs and Elves (Drow)`  
You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.  
When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.  
You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.  
_**Deft Explorer.**_  You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.
 - _**Canny.**_ Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen skill.  
 You can also speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice.  

_**Fighting Style.**_
- _**Blind Fighting.**_ You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

_**Combat Superiority.**_ At 2nd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.
 - _**Maneuvers.**_ You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are chosen from the list of maneuvers available to fighters with the Battle Master archetype. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.  
 You learn one additional maneuver of your choice at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Each time you learn a new maneuver, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.
 - _**Superiority Dice.**_  You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.  
 You gain another superiority die at 9th level and one more at 17th level.
 - _**Saving Throws.**_ Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
 Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

_**Hunter's Prey.**_ At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

 - _**Giant Killer.**_ When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
 - _**Horde Breaker.**_ Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

## Background - Archaeologist
_**Dust Digger.**_ Prior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins. Though you managed to sell a few of your discoveries and earn enough coin to buy proper adventuring gear, you have held onto an item that has great emotional value to you. It is a whip, for whipping.  
_**Feature: Historical Knowledge.**_ When you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were dwarves, elves, humans, yuan-ti, or some other known race. In addition, you can determine the monetary value of art objects more than a century old.
